Networks (i.e. natural graphs social networks communication networks interactions between genes and proteins brain connections Graphs as a representation similarity networks 3d shapes particle-based physics simulations Why is it hard modern deep learning methods designed for simple sequences and grids (e.g. images) networks are complex arbitrary size no fixed node ordering or reference point often dynamic Deep learning in graphs want to build neural networks that take a graph as input and make output predictions at the level of: individual nodes links (i.e. pairs of nodes) new graphs / sub-graphs Representation learning map nodes to d-dimensional embeddings (using a function that is learned) such that similar nodes in the network are embedded close together 1.2 Applications of Graph ML Link to video 1.3 Choice of Graph Representation Link to video 2.1 Traditional Feature-based Methods: Node "],["literature.html", "Chapter 2 Literature", " Chapter 2 Literature Here is a review of existing methods.
