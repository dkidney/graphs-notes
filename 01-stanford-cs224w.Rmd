#### 1.1 Why Graphs {-#stanford1pt1}

* Many types of data that can naturally be represented as graphs
* Explicitly modeling the relational structure allows us to build more accurate models

##### Types of networks and graphs {-}

Sometimes the distinction between these two types (networks and graphs) is blurred.

1. Networks (i.e. natural graphs

* social networks
* communication networks
* interactions between genes and proteins
* brain connections

2. Graphs as a representation

* similarity networks
* 3d shapes
* particle-based physics simulations

##### Why is it hard {-}

* modern deep learning methods designed for simple sequences and grids (e.g. images)
* networks are complex
  * arbitrary size
  * no fixed node ordering or reference point
  * often dynamic

##### Deep learning in graphs {-}

* want to build neural networks that take a graph as input and make output predictions at the level of:
  * individual nodes
  * links (i.e. pairs of nodes)
  * new graphs / sub-graphs
  
##### Representation learning {-}

* map nodes to d-dimensional embeddings (using a function that is learned) such that similar nodes in the network are embedded close together

#### 1.2 Applications of Graph ML {-}

##### classic graph ML tasks {-}

* node classification - predicting a property of a node
* link prediction - predicting whether there are missing links
* graph classification - categorizing graphs
* clustering - community detection
* graph generation
* graph evolution

##### node-level example: protein folding {-}

* given a sequence of amino acids can we predict the 3d structure of the protein
* in 2020 DeepMind announced AlphaFold which performed this task with high accuracy
* key idea was to represent the amino acids as a spatial graph
  * nodes = amino acids
  * edges = proximity between amino acids

##### edge-level example: ??? {-}
